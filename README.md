## 1. 📖Problem description
The modern gaming landscape is increasingly dominated by ‘Triple-A’ titles characterized by corporate bloat, formulaic storytelling, and predatory monetization. Instead of offering an artistic escape, many games utilize ‘dark patterns’- psychological loops designed to encourage gambling and excessive spending/ Furthermore, digital items in these ecosystems are ‘dead-end-assets’, which means players spend money or time acquiring items that hold no value once the player moves on. This stagnation has created a barrier for players seeking genuine creativity, social connection, and a sense of ownership over their digital experience.

## 2. 🎯Target users
### Nostalgia Players

People who have played games for a while would love the 8bit design of the game. The game itself would take them back and they would take comfort in the familiarity of it.  
### Indie Game Fans

Indie games are a very popular category. Some people play games for the sake of it being an indie game, this would be able to reach them.  
### Genre Enthusiasts
Some people enjoy playing older games in general. Although this game is very recent, people would appreciate the old-like graphics for the game. Games like Stardew valley(10M+ sold), Undertale(10M+ sold) and Shovel Knight(10M+ sold) are all pixel games that have gained popularity and a strong consumer base. 
### Storage-Conscious (space conserve)
Nowadays games take up a lot of storage, this makes the user upset and discouraged. Most users do not want a single game to take up their entire storage. Since our game will have low graphics,it will take up less storage. 
### Youth & Younger Audiences
The graphics and color style will be appealing to the younger audience. Kids often find the pixels to be visually appealing.
